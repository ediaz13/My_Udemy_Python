# You can use the `Server` header in the HTTP response to determine the type of web server running on port 80. Here's a Python code example using the `requests` library to send an HTTP request and check the `Server` header:

import requests

def check_server_type(url):
    try:
        # Send a GET request to the URL
        response = requests.get(url)

        # Check if the 'Server' header is present in the response
        if 'Server' in response.headers:
            server_header = response.headers['Server']
            print(f"The server running on port 80 is: {server_header}")
        else:
            print("The 'Server' header is not present in the response.")

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"HTTP request failed: {e}")

def main():
    # URL of the website running on port 80
    url = "http://192.168.124.216/mutillidae/"

    print("Checking server type...")
    check_server_type(url)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# Replace url with the actual URL of the website you want to check. When you run this code, it will send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and check if the `Server` header is present in the response. If present, it will print the value of the `Server` header, which typically contains information about the web server software. This can help you determine if the website is running Apache, Nginx, IIS, or another server software.
