# Here's an example of a basic password strength checker:

# Password Strength Checker

def check_password_strength(password):
    # Minimum length requirement
    min_length = 8

    # Check if password meets minimum length requirement
    if len(password) < min_length:
        return "Password is too short. Minimum length should be {} characters.".format(min_length)

    # Check if password contains both uppercase and lowercase letters
    has_uppercase = any(char.isupper() for char in password)
    has_lowercase = any(char.islower() for char in password)
    if not (has_uppercase and has_lowercase):
        return "Password should contain both uppercase and lowercase letters."

    # Check if password contains at least one digit
    has_digit = any(char.isdigit() for char in password)
    if not has_digit:
        return "Password should contain at least one digit."

    # Check if password contains at least one special character
    special_characters = "!@#$%^&*()-_+=[]{}|;:,.<>?/"
    has_special_char = any(char in special_characters for char in password)
    if not has_special_char:
        return "Password should contain at least one special character."

    # If all checks pass, password is considered strong
    return "Password is strong."

def main():
    # Get password from user input
    password = input("Enter your password: ")

    # Check password strength
    result = check_password_strength(password)
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# The `check_password_strength()` function takes a password as input and checks various criteria to determine its strength.
# It checks if the password meets the minimum length requirement, contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, contains at least one digit, and contains at least one special character.
# If the password meets all criteria, it is considered strong. Otherwise, it returns a message indicating which criteria the password fails to meet.
# In the `main()` function, the user is prompted to enter a password, and its strength is checked using the `check_password_strength()` function.
