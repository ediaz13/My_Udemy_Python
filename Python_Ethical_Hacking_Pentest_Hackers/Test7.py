# Simple Python code example that demonstrates basic concepts such as variables, input/output, conditional statements, and string manipulation:

# This program greets the user and checks if their name contains the letter 'a'

def main():
    # Get user's name
    name = input("Enter your name: ")

    # Greet the user
    print("Hello,", name + "!")

    # Check if the name contains the letter 'a'
    if 'a' in name.lower():
        print("Your name contains the letter 'a'.")
    else:
        print("Your name does not contain the letter 'a'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

# The `main()` function is defined to contain the main logic of the program.
# The user is prompted to enter their name using the `input()` function, and the input is stored in the variable `name`.
# The program greets the user using the `print()` function, concatenating the user's name with the greeting message.
# It checks if the name contains the letter 'a' using a conditional statement (`if-else`).
# If the name contains 'a', it prints a message indicating that. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating the absence of 'a' in the name.
# Finally, the `main()` function is called to execute the program.
